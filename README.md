A short manual for how futuregerald works.

## What do you want us to know about your communication style?

- I like it when I'm given more information than I ask for, since I don't always think of all the questions ahead of time
- I need honesty
- I don't always volunteer information but I'm an open book and don't mind answering questions and engaging on any topic
- I like knowing people, knowing about their lives and feeling like we're more than just colleagues
- I'm fascinated by random things, and sometimes I want to talk about them :)
- I like it when people are explicit about the ways they like to communicate and work 
- I enjoy doing voice/video calls

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?

- Left to my own devices, I'll spend too much time on individual problems or issues
- If you are expecting something from me, I like to know as much of your expectations as possible (I appreciate clarity)
- I research everything
- I wear my heart on my sleeve but criticism drives me to do better
- I believe that I can learn and accomplish anything
- I'm bad at personal confrontations
- I'm very positive! My default answer is "Yes" and I love shooting for the stars.

## How can you best work with me?

- Be honest
- Be clear
- Give me more information than you think I need
- I know your busy, but try and respond if I message you, even if it's a day or two later. Later is better than never. 
- Let me do my job
- Let me see your emotions :)

## What are your pet peeves?

- Going to someone else for something that's supposed to be my job
- Not communicating with me regarding any criticisms or complaints you have
- Communicating with me late, tell me as soon as you know how you feel!
- Never responding. I get you won't always be able to respond, but even if  you respond days later, it's better than nothing. (I'm bad at following up after initiating contact if I don't receive a response)

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?

- I experience social anxiety
- I lack self-confidence
- I'm bad at time management
- I bring too much of myself to work
- I overthink situations
